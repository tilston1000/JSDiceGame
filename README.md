# JavaScript Dice Game

This quite straightforward game, written in JavaScript, showcases some skills in relation to the DOM and Events, notably:

- selecting and manipulating elements
- handling click events
- manipulating CSS styles
- refactoring the code, using the DRY principle

The aim of this game is for each player to roll the dice, until such a time that they:
a) hold, meaning that the cumulative total is added to their score
b) roll a '1' meaning that any points acquired during the current session are lost

Once a specific score is reached(configurable in script.js, then the game is over)
